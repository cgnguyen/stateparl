# Stateparl

This repository provides helpful code/data to be used with StateParl. 

Specifically, 

1) we provide code to turn the raw data into a quanteda corpus
2) Add additional information to the dataset (e.g. speaker identification + government / opposition status for parties)
3) Analysis code for the paper introducing the StateParl dataset (Found in the PVS Folder) . This code should be relatively easy to be adjusted for similar research designs. 


The StateParl data can be found at https://search.gesis.org/research_data/SDN-10.7802-2854 /  DOI: 10.7802/2854
Auxiliary Data are still being validated, but feel free to contact me for a draft version. 

If you use this data or code, please cite the original release paper (Nguyen et. al, forthcomming) and this repository using the citation button on this repository.
